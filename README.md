21 September 2012, San Jose, CA (USA)

In conjunction with the

International Conference on Autonomic Computing, San Jose, 18-20 Sep. 2012.

## Summary

This event will be run as a workshop in conjunction with ICAC 2012 and will bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss the newest ideas and challenges in cloud services and federated cloud computing. With your help, we hope to accelerate the discussion in both commercial and academic contexts.

## Focus of the Workshop

The services offered by clouds are becoming critical for a wide variety of applications used by industry, education and government.There are now many examples of successful cloud services offered by public, private and community clouds. Many efforts exist that are creating cloud toolkits and frameworks to simplify the development and delivery of cloud services.

The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together those responsible for designing, managing, and operating clouds services so that they can share experiences with each other. The workshop also welcomes users with requirements for new cloud services.

We are particularly interested in cloud services that can be used for federating clouds. Topics of interest include:

* Experiences, best practices, and lessons learned from operating cloud services
* Testbeds for designing new cloud services
* Cloud services for federating clouds
* Management and provisioning of cloud services
* Health and status monitoring of cloud services
* Security of cloud services
* Requirements for new cloud services
* Reliability and fault tolerance of cloud services
* Cloud services that span public and private clouds
* Design of cloud services
* Intercloud services
* Federation service
* Identity services
* Cloud bursting services
* Cloud services for emerging applications
* Applications utilizing such services
* Cloud Software and Tools
* IaaS, PaaS, …, Hadoop, …

This workshop will build upon the success of the prior Open Cirrus events and the prior Open Cloud Consortium events. The goal is to help building a community for those responsible for operating clouds and cloud testbeds, as well as those interested in designing new cloud services.

## Sponsors

The Workshop is co-sponsored by the Open Cirrus Consortium and the Open Cloud Consortium, and FutureGrid.

## Paper Format

Full papers (a maximum of 6 pages in the two-column ACM proceedings format) are invited on a wide variety of topics relating to federated clouds and their application. Submitted papers must be original work, and may not be under consideration for another conference or journal. Complete formatting and submission instructions can be found on the workshop web site. Accepted papers will appear in proceedings distributed at the conference and available electronically.
