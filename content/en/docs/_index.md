A workshop in conjunction with ICAC 2012 that will brings together
researchers and practitioners to discuss ideas and
challenges in cloud services and federated cloud computing. With your
help, we hope to accelerate the discussion in both commercial and
academic contexts.

## Focus of the Workshop

The services offered by clouds are becoming critical for a wide
variety of applications used by industry, education and
government.There are now many examples of successful cloud services
offered by public, private and community clouds. Many efforts exist
that are creating cloud toolkits and frameworks to simplify the
development and delivery of cloud services.

The main purpose of this workshop is to bring together those
responsible for designing, managing, and operating clouds services so
that they can share experiences with each other. The workshop also
welcomes users with requirements for new cloud services.

We are particularly interested in cloud services that can be used for
federating clouds. Topics of interest include:

* Experiences, best practices, and lessons learned from operating cloud services
* Testbeds for designing new cloud services
* Cloud services for federating clouds
* Management and provisioning of cloud services
* Health and status monitoring of cloud services
* Security of cloud services
* Requirements for new cloud services
* Reliability and fault tolerance of cloud services
* Cloud services that span public and private clouds
  * Design of cloud services
  * Intercloud services
  * Federation service
  * Identity services
  * Cloud bursting services
  * Cloud services for emerging applications
* Applications utilizing such services
* Cloud Software and Tools
* IaaS, PaaS, Hadoop

This workshop will build upon the success of the prior Open Cirrus
events and the prior Open Cloud Consortium events. The goal is to help
building a community for those responsible for operating clouds and
cloud testbeds, as well as those interested in designing new cloud
services.

    abstract = {We present the design of a dynamic provisioning system
                that is able to manage the resources of a federated
                cloud environment by focusing on their
                utilization. With our framework, it is not only
                possible to allocate resources at a particular time to
                a specific Infrastructure as a Service framework, but
                also to utilize them as part of a typical HPC
                environment controlled by batch queuing
                systems. Through this interplay between virtualized
                and non-virtualized resources, we provide a flexible
                resource management framework that can be adapted
                based on users' demands. The need for such a framework
                is motivated by real user data gathered during our
                operation of FutureGrid (FG). We observed that the
                usage of the different infrastructures vary over time
                changing from being over-utilized to underutilize and
                vice versa. Therefore, the proposed framework will be
                beneficial for users of environments such a FutureGrid
                where several infrastructures are supported with
                limited physical resources.},
